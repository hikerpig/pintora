title: Entity Relationship Diagram
---

> An entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).

The syntax is based on Mermaid 8.9. This diagram should start with `erDiagram`.

## Basic syntax

```
<entity-a> [<relationship> <entity-b> : <relationship-label> [<key>]]
```

- `<entity-a>` and `<entity-b>` are the names of entities.
- `<relationship>` shows how the two entities are related.
- `<relationship-label>` is a label that describes the relationship from entity-a's perspective.
- `<key>` is a decoration field that - if specified - appears in the first row, pretty useful for database diagram.

```pintora play
erDiagram
  CUSTOMER {
    int id PK
    int address FK
  }
  CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
  ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
  CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
  ORDER {
    int orderNumber PK
    int customer FK
    string deliveryAddress
  }
```

## Override config

You can override diagarm config through `@param` directive.

All available configs can be seen in the [Config page](../configuration/config.md#er).

```pintora play
erDiagram
  @param fill #aabb00
  @param stroke #aacc00
  @param textColor #cc4488
  @param attributeFill #fcfff2
  @param labelBackground #white
  @param fontSize 16
