> An entityâ€“relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).
> <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">Wikipedia</a></cite>

The syntax is based on [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/entityRelationshipDiagram) 8.9. This diagram should start with `erDiagram`.

## Basic syntax

```text
<entity-a> [<relationship> <entity-b> : <relationship-label> [<key>] ["<comment>"]]
```

- `<entity-a>` and `<entity-b>` are the names of entities.
- `<relationship>` shows how the two entities are related.
- `<relationship-label>` is a label that describes the relationship from entity-a's perspective.
- `<key>` is a decoration field that - if specified - appears in the first row, pretty useful for database diagram.
- `<comment>` is a double-quoted string for comments.

  title: Entity Relationship Example
  CUSTOMER {
    int id PK
    int address FK
  }
  CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
  ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
  CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
  ORDER {
    int orderNumber PK
    int customer FK "customer id"
    string deliveryAddress
  }
```

## Relationship Syntax

```text
CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
```

This can be read as `a CUSTOMER can places zero or more ORDERs, where as an ORDER belongs to only one CUSTOMER`.

The relationship part of each statement can be broken down into three sub-components:

1. the cardinality of the first entity with respect to the second,
2. whether the relationship confers identity on a 'child' entity
3. the cardinality of the second entity with respect to the first

### Cardinality

**Cardinality** defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities. In the above example an CUSTOMER can have zero or more ORDER instances associated to it, whereas a ORDER can only be associated with one CUSTOMER.

In each cardinality marker there are two characters. The outermost character represents a maximum value, and the innermost character represents a minimum value. The table below summarises possible cardinalities.

| Value (left) | Value (right) | Meaning                       |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| \|o          | o\|           | Zero or one                   |
| \|\|         | \|\|          | Exactly one                   |
| }o           | o{            | Zero or more (no upper limit) |
| }\|          | \|{           | One or more (no upper limit)  |

### Identification

Relationships may be classified as either identifying or non-identifying and these are rendered with either solid or dashed lines respectively.

This is relevant when one of the entities in question can not have independent existence without the other.

## Inheritance

You can specificy specialization - or inheritance in the other word - with the `inherit` keyword.

This is a useful feature for expressing your design in [extended entity-relationship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_entity%E2%80%93relationship_model).

```pintora play
erDiagram
  person {
    int age
    string phone_number
  }

  customer inherit person
  deliverer inherit person

  %% some extra attributes for customer
  customer {
    string address
  }
```

## Override config

You can override diagarm config through `@param` directive.

All available configs can be seen in the [Config page](../configuration/config.md#er).

```pintora play
erDiagram
  @param fill #aabb00
  @param stroke #aacc00
  @param textColor #cc4488
  @param attributeFill #fcfff2
  @param labelBackground #white
  @param fontSize 16
  @param borderRadius 4
  @param edgeType ortho

  artists {
    INTEGER ArtistId
    NVARCHAR Name
  }
  albums

  artists ||--o{ albums : "publishes"
  artists }|--|{ labels : "a member of"
```
