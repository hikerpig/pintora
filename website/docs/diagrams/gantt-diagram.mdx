title: Gantt Diagram
---

> A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, named after its popularizer, Henry Gantt (1861–1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910–1915.[1][2] Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency relationships between activities and the current schedule status.

The syntax and layout logic of Gantt diagrams is based on Mermaid 8.14, but there are some subtle differences.
