## Introduction

The Activity Diagram is inspired by PlantUML's [Activity Diagram Beta Syntax](https://plantuml.com/en/activity-diagram-beta).

## Simple Action

Simple action starts with `:` and ends with `;`, with description between them.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  :Aciton 1;
  :Aciton 2;
```

## `start`/`end` keyword

You can use `start` and `end` keyword to denote the beginning and the end of a diagram.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  start
  :No pain;
  :No gain;
  end
```

## Conditional

You can use `if`, `then` and `else` to put tests and branches. Labels can be provided using parentheses.

- `if (...) then (...)`

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  if (diagram registered ?) then
    :get implementation;
  else (no)
    :print error;
  endif
```

## While Loop

You can use `while` and `endwhile` to make repeat loops.

And it's possibleto provide a label after the `endwhile` keyword, or using the `is` keyword to provide label for the link.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  start
  while (data available)
    :read data;
    :generate diagrams;
  endwhile

  while (met another test) is (yes)
    :do something;
  endwhile (done)
  end
```

## Switch And Case

You can use `switch`, `case` and `endswitch` to pu switch sentences.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  switch (test ?)
  case ( condition A )
    :Text 1;
  case ( condition B )
    :Text 2;
  case ( condition C )
    :Text 3;
  endswitch
```

## Grouping

You can use several keywords to make groups:

- `group`
- `partition`

And it's possible to add color `#\d{6}` after the grouping keyword to specify background color.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  start
  partition Init {
    :Read config;

    group #88bbf4 Process {
      :Init themes;
      :Init symbols;
    }
  }
  end
```

## Note

Add `@note`, placement, and participant names after action to add a note.

1. placement keywords `left` and `right`.
1. note can be multiline, in this case you need to add `@end_note` to end it.

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  start
  :Some action;
  @note right: note on the right

  if (diagram registered ?) then
    :get implementation;
  else (no)
    :print error;
  endif

  @note left
  left multiline note,
  no colon after placement
  @end_note
  end
```

## Arrow Label

In the next line of action, you can add label to the arrow with the arrow label notation.

Currently only single line text is supported.

```
-> multiline description;
```

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  start
  :Action 1;
  -> Hey there;
  :Action 2;
  end
```


## Override config

You can override diagarm style config through `@style` directive.

All available configs can be seen in the [Config page](../configuration/config.md#activity).

```pintora play
activityDiagram
  @style actionBackground #61afef
  @style textColor #fff
  @style noteTextColor #purple
  @style edgeColor #143C9A
  @style {
    keywordBackground #143C9A
    labelTextColor #143C9A
  }
  start
  partition Init {
    :Read config;
    @note right: comment
  }
  while (data available) is (yes)
    :read data;
  endwhile
  end
```
