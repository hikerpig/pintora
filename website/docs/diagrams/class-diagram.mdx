title: Class Diagram
---

<span className="badge badge--info">WIP</span> This is released under [alpha channel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pintora/standalone?activeTab=versions), `0.7.0-alpha.0` .It's not yet stable, more examples are needed.

> A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

## A simple demo

```pintora play
classDiagram
  class Fruit {
    <<interface>>
    float sweetness
    -float age

    float getAge()
  }

  class Apple {
    float softness
    {static} Apple fromString(str)
  }

  %% There are so many kind of fruits
  Fruit <|-- Apple
  Fruit <|-- Kiwi
  Fruit <|-- Banana

  Fruit "many" --* "1" Bag: packed into
```

## Define a class

## Class members

To declare fields and methods, you can use the symbol `:` followed by the field's or method's name.

It is also possible to group between brackets `{}` all fields and methods.

You can write type and name in any order you prefer.

```pintora play
classDiagram
  class Fruit {
    float sweetness

    squeeze()
  }

  Fruit : getAge(): float
```

### Member visibility

Define member visibility with these symbols. The notaiton is optional but it should be placed before the member.

- `+` public
- `#` protected
- `-` private
- `~` package/internal

## Class annotations

You can annotate classes with markers to provide additional metadata about the class. This can give a clearer indication about its nature. Some common annotations include:

- `<<interface>>` To represent an interface class
- `<<enumeration>>` To represent an enum

Annotations are defined within the opening `<<` and closing `>>`. There are two ways to add an annotation to a class:

```pintora play
classDiagram
  class Shape
  <<interface>> Shape
  Shape : vertices
  Shape : draw()

  class Color {
    <<enumeration>>
    Red
    Green
    Blue
  }
```

## Relations between classes

You can define relations between classes using following symbols :

| Type    | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `<\|--` | Inheritance |
| `*--`   | Composition |
| `o--`   | Aggregation |
| `-->`   | Association |
| `--`    | Link        |

It is possible to replace `--` by `..` to have a dotted line.

```pintora play
classDiagram
classA <|-- classB
classC *-- classD
classE o-- classF
classG <-- classH
classI -- classJ
classK <.. classL
classM <|.. classN
classO .. classP
```

### Label on relations

You can add a label on the relation, using `:`, followed by the text of the label.

Also, you can use double-quotes `""` on each side of the relation for cardinality.

```pintora play
classDiagram
  classA "1" *-- "many" classB : contains
  classC o-- classD : aggregation
  classE --> "1" classF
```

## Override config

You can override diagarm config through `@param` directive.

All available configs can be seen in the [Config page](../configuration/config.md#class).

```pintora play
classDiagram
  @param entityBackground #61afef

  class Animal {
  }

  class Dog {
    void bark()
  }

  Animal <|-- Dog
```
